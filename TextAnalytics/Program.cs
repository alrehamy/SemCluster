            s = "Ben Afflecks film Argo tells the bizarre story of how in 1980 the CIA - with Canadian help - sprang a group of Americans from Iran after they escaped a US embassy overrun by protestors. The film, which has received seven Oscar nominations including one for best picture, is based on real-life events. But how much of it is fiction? When Mark Lijek took Tehran as his first posting in the US foreign service, he knew he wasnt opting for an easy life. \"I was asked to volunteer in October 1978 and things in Iran were already pretty bad,\" he explains. \"There were violent demonstrations on the streets and it wasnt at all clear the Shah could survive. Then in January he abdicated and left the country\". Mark did a six-month course in Farsi before arriving in Iran in the summer of 1979, followed by his wife. Cora Lijek wasnt a foreign service official but was given a contract because the embassy urgently needed Farsi speakers. The couple couldnt have guessed how quickly they would find themselves in extraordinary circumstances. The US embassy in Tehran consisted of 26 acres surrounded by more than a mile of wall, with only 13 marines to protect it. Not long before Marks arrival it had been overrun by anti-American protestors who had left after a few hours. So when demonstrators again broke in, early on 4 November 1979, Mark initially assumed the same thing might happen. \"Mainly the protest was because America had chosen to admit the Shah for medical treatment. The consular building, where Cora and I worked, was at least five minutes from the main chancery building and had its own door onto the street. \"The people who broke in forgot about us or initially didnt much care\". Image caption Ben Affleck (centre) both directs and stars in Argo, which came out in the UK last year Mark Lijek, now retired, is impressed with how Ben Affleck stages the taking of the US embassy in Argo, a sequence filmed partly in Istanbul and partly on location in California. \"It was almost the first time Id thought deeply about what it must have been like for the 50 or so Americans in the main building,\" he tells the BBC. \"Those scenes were quite difficult to watch\". It is after the six Americans slip away from the embassy that Argo becomes a masterclass in reshaping reality into a Hollywood hit. ";

            //s = "Netflix just wont stop making big movies. In a year thats already seen hit original releases like Burning Sands, Girlfriends Day, and The Discovery, comes Sand Castle, a war drama starring Nicholas Hoult and Henry Cavill. Youd think with big stars like that the movie would get a theatrical release, but nope, Netflix scooped it up. But regardless of how the movie makes its way to viewers, its content is important and timely, as it takes place during the Iraq War. So knowing that, you may be wondering: is Sand Castle based on a true story? In a way, yes. The film is the debut script from screenwriter Chris Roessner, who based it on his own experiences as a machine gunner for the army in Iraqs Sunni Triangle in 2003. The film tells the story of a group of American soldiers who find themselves in a dangerous situation trying to save the Iraqi village of Baqubah. Roessner, who enlisted in the armed forces when he was just 17, says he got the idea to become a screenwriter after watching Platoon in Saddam Husseins palace. Heres what he told henrycavill.org about the films genesis: I served in the U.S. Army and was deployed to Iraq during the initial invasion. This was 2003-2004. I spent a year there and, even before, knew I wanted to be a filmmaker. I remember seeing Oliver Stone’s film Platoon at 3 am. I was in Saddam Hussein’s palace in Tikrit and the film ended just as the sun was coming up. It was a moment changed my life. I thought... I had no idea you could make a film so deeply personal, so poetic, about the journey through war and the search for meaning. It wasn’t a ‘mission’ movie. That is to say it wasn’t a film about one particular goal, but it was more experiential. It was a film about searching, about the struggle for a young man to keep his soul intact even though the war was trying to corrupt it. I wanted to do something akin to that. You could trace this movie back to that moment in 2004. And while some characters and details of the film are based on Roessners own war experiences, the film itself is not a recreation of something that actually happened to him. Its inspired by his experiences, but its not necessarily based on a true story. In an interview with Go Into The Storys Scott Myers back in 2013, after Roessners script had made the 2012 Black List but before it had been picked up, the writer admits that the main plot of the movie, which has to do with repairing an aqueduct in the village, didnt even come about until his third or fourth draft: The aqueduct is one of those devices that didn’t show up until several drafts in. This movie didn’t have a plot until the third or fourth draft. It was just a bunch of scenes on a clothesline, not really relating to each other. We talked about Bridge on the River Kwai and I think that’s how we stumbled onto the aqueduct as the story that would be the thrust of the war but also something that wasn’t arbitrary. So while Sand Castle is inspired by Chris Roessners real army experience, its not necessarily based on an actual event. However, its still a very accurate portrayal of what life was like in the Iraq War, written by someone who knows.";

Healthcare systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of target populations. Their exact configuration varies between national and subnational entities. In some countries and jurisdictions, healthcare planning is distributed among market participants, whereas in others, planning occurs more centrally among governments or other coordinating bodies.

So, no, I would not agree that it a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. J.P.

            //s = "George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He was also the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial win over Democratic rival Al Gore, becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent. From a prominent political family, he is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States, making him only the second president to assume the nation's highest office after his father, following the lead of John Quincy Adams. His brother, Jeb Bush, a former Governor of Florida, was a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election. His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a United States Senator from Connecticut. The September 11 terrorist attacks occurred eight months into Bush's first term as president. Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine: launching a \"War on Terror\", an international military campaign that included the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003. He also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, Social Security reform, and amending the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. His tenure included national debates on immigration, Social Security, electronic surveillance, and torture. In the 2004 Presidential race, Bush defeated Democratic Senator John Kerry in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum for his handling of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, and other challenges. Amid this criticism, the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession, often referred to as the \"Great Recession\", prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis. Bush left office in 2009, returning to Texas where he purchased a home in Crawford. He wrote a memoir, Decision Points. His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in historians' polls published in the late 2000s and 2010s.";

For efficient and accurate modelling of railway structural components taking the unbounded media into account, a hybrid method based on a combination of the conventional finite element method and scaled boundary finite element method is established. In the paper, element matrices and solution procedures for the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) are derived.

In its first hour or so, this picture appears to be a gloriously spiteful and well-acted satire of our bogus contemporary \"crisis of masculinity\": self-pitying guys hugging in groups and claiming victim status - modern consumer society having allegedly rendered the poor dears' hunter-gathering instincts obsolete. But, by the end, it has unravelled catastrophically into a strident, shallow, pretentious bore with a \"twist\" ending that doesn't work. And it is a film which smugly flirts, oh-so-very-controversially, with some of the intellectual and cultural paraphernalia of fascism - but does not have anything like the nerve, still less the cerebral equipment, to back this pose up. Edward Norton gives a compulsively twitchy, nerdy, hollow-eyed performance as Fight Club's Narrator: a 30-year-old single guy with a white collar job in the automotive industry and a secret addiction; he loves attending support groups posing as a sufferer. Hilariously, this is the only thing that gives him an emotional high. Fight Club has a classic scene where he turns up at a testicular cancer victims' group and the participants have to pair off, hugging, sobbing and letting it all out.

In  practice,   the keyphrases of a document should not only be   statistically   important   in   the   document,  but  also  have  a  good  coverage  of the  document. Based  on  this  observation, we propose an unsupervised method for   keyphrase   extraction.

DURBAN, South Africa - Yvo de Boer said he left his job as the U.N.'s top climate official in frustration 18 months ago, believing the process of negotiating a meaningful climate agreement is failing. His opinion hasn't changed. I still have the same view of the process that led me to leave the process,  he told the Associated Press on Sunday.  I'm still deeply concerned about where it's going, or rather where it's not going, about the lack of progress.  For three years until 2010, the Dutch civil servant was the leading voice on global warming on the world stage. He appeared constantly in public to advocate green policies, traveled endlessly for private meetings with top leaders and labored with negotiators seeking ways to finesse snags in drafting agreements. In the end he felt he  wasn't really able to contribute as I should be to the process,  he said. Today, he can take a long view on his years as a Dutch negotiator in the 1990s and later as a senior U.N. official with access to the highest levels of government, business and civil society. He is able to voice criticisms he was reluctant to air when he was actively shepherding climate diplomacy. Negotiators live  in a separate universe,  and the ongoing talks are  like a log that's drifted away,  he said. Then, using another metaphor, he called the annual 194-nation conferences  a bit of a mouse wheel. Elsewhere in Durban Sunday, the South African host of the talks called for divine help at a climate change church service organized by the South African Council of Churches. We needed to pray for [an] acceptable, balanced outcome, that has a sense of urgency,  said Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, who as South Africa's foreign minister is president of the Durban round of negotiations. Negotiators have been at the job so long - since the 1992 climate convention - that they have lost touch with the real world, he said. But it wasn't their fault. I completely understand that it is very difficult for a negotiator to move if you haven't been given a political sense of direction and the political space to move,  he said. Rather than act in their own national interests, many leaders look to see what others are willing - or unwilling - to concede. You've got a bunch of international leaders sitting 85 stories up on the edge of a building saying to each other, 'You jump first and I'll follow.' And there is understandably a reluctance to be the first one to jump,  he said. source: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/4/ex-top-climate-official-very-concerned-by-global-l/";

            s = "    A study has found that the U.S. death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted, the head of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday to mark the opening of the 1988 Atlantic storm season.    Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said center director Bob Sheets.    Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties from Maine to Texas, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier islands is virtually impossible, Sheets said.    There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there are serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said.    During a hurricane that struck Houston, ``glass was flying everywhere,'' said Sheets.    He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season, saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict the number and severity of storms.    The first tropical depression of the year has formed, and remained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip of Cuba, or about 200 miles southwest of Havana. The system contained winds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen.    One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could fail this year, forecasters said.    ``It's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West at anytime,'' hurricane specialist Bob Case said of the Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which records atmospheric conditions over the Pacific Ocean and part of the Western Hemisphere.    If that satellite does stop working, GOES-East would have to be directed to move from its equatorial orbit over Brazil to a spot south of the Texas Gulf Coast, where it would provide a view of the Western Hemisphere with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning eastern Atlantic, he said.    A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprived meteorologists of Atlantic atmospheric photographs.    A typical Atlantic hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has 10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind exceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenching rain and wind over 74 mph, Case said.    In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the Atlantic.    ";

Two new fires flared Wednesday in the Sierra National Forest, one over about 1,800 acres west of Kings Canyon National Park; the other near Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park. The Mariposa blaze destroyed at least one home and grew to 250 acres.    Fire crews mobilized in the Star Valley of eastern Idaho after the 6,800-acre Trail Creek fire, fanned by shifting winds, broke through a control line and raced to within a mile of ranches and grain fields.

The Canyon Creek fire is burning toward several ranches outside the wilderness, while firefighters are trying to prevent the other two fires from burning south into the park.    Gov.

'I suddenly could see the strength of the masculinity about it - the usefulness of it to the subject struck me at that point, and since then I've used that' (Lucas quoted in Barber, p.16).
